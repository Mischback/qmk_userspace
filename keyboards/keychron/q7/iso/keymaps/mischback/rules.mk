# The Keychron Q7 features a DIP switch at the back that let users switch
# between Mac and Windows layouts.
#
# While this feature is deactivated, the default selection of layers in
# Keychron's default keymap is not working and the first layer will be applied
# as the default to the keyboard (not an issue, as this layer is custom anyway).
